# This config is meant to be included from ~/.gitconfig
# Here's an example of how this can be done:
#[include]
#    path = ~/.config/git/gitconfig

[core]
    editor = nvim

[include]
    path = config.d/alias.gitconfig

# WSL specific global configuration because sometimes it needs to point to the Windows side of
# things (e.g. credential manager).
[includeif "gitdir:/"]
    path = ~/.config/git/config.d/wsl

# Windows specific global configuration.
[includeif "gitdir:*:/"]
    path = ~/.config/git/config.d/windows
